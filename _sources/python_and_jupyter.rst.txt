Introduction to Python, via Jupyter

.. code-links:: clear

This is a Jupyter Notebook.

For the moment, I'll introduce the Notebook, and then get on to how Python
works.

********************
A Notebook has cells
********************

As you can see, the Jupyter Notebook runs in your web browser.

It consists of *cells*. This is a text cell.  The cell below is a code cell.

You can mix code and text cells in any order.

We won't pay much attention to text cells for now, but they are very useful to
weave explanation and code, to justify and explain your analysis.

To move from one cell to the next, you can use Shift-Enter. When you do
this inside a code cell, it will execute, and move to the next cell.

What follows is a code cell.  In fact, it is Python code.  Press Shift-Enter
to move out of this cell into the code cell, and Shift-Enter again to execute
the code cell.

.. nbplot::

    >>> a = 10

Now you've executed the code cell, it doesn't look as if anything has
happened, but when you did Shift-Enter in the cell above, the Jupyter Notebook
sent the code off to be executed by `Python <https://python.org>`_.  Python is
a programming language with a easy-to-read syntax that is widely used for
teaching, and for data analysis.  It's very popular in academia, and in
industry, especially for data analysis.

.. what we have to cover

   A variable as a name referring to something.
   LHS and RHS
   The type of a thing
   Numbers
   Strings
   Lists
   True and False
   Functions
   Sum

************
Reading code
************

When you learn programming, and even when you get a lot of experience, it is
useful to read to yourself what the code is doing.

In the cell above, we are *setting* a *variable*.

When we set a variable, the statement has two parts.  There is the Left Hand
Side (or LHS), to the left of the equals sign.  In our case the LHS is ``a``.
``a`` is a *name*, that we are giving to the *contents* from the Right Hand
Side (RHS)

The RHS is the number ``10``.  We can read the statement ``a = 10`` in a
verbose way as "Make the name ``a`` refer to the number ``10``.  After this
statement, we can say that *variable* (name) ``a`` has *value* (refers to) the
number ``10``.

When working on code, we often want to see the values of variables, and the
Notebook makes it easy to do that. We put the variable whose value we want to
see on its own at the end of a cell. Here the variable is a Right Hand Side,
without a Left Hand Side.  The Notebook detects that we have done that, and
shows us the value.  Here we display the value of the variable ``a``:

.. nbplot::

    >>> a
    10

Notice that the Notebook made a new type of display after the cell, with the
prompt in red, and starting with ``Out[``.

Our code cells can have lines that do some work, followed by a variable on its
own, so we can see its value. Like this:

.. nbplot::

    >>> b = 5
    >>> b
    5

Now we know how to read the first line as "make the name ``b`` refer to the
number ``5``.  Read the second line as "show me what the name ``b`` refers
to".

Time for an exercise:

* Start a new Notebook;
* Set the name ``a`` to refer to the number 6
* Set the name ``c`` to refer to the name ``a``
* What do you think the name ``c`` refers to now, when we show it?  Try and
  predict.  Then try showing the value in the Notebook.

****************************************
The Right Hand Side can be an expression
****************************************

We have seen a couple of code cells with the variable (name) on the LHS,
followed by an equals sign ``=``, followed by a RHS, that is a number, ``10``
or ``5``.

The RHS does not have to be a value, like a number.  It can be an *expression*
- some code, that Python understands, that ends up returning a value.

For example, Python understands the expression ``5 + 6`` to mean "add the
numbers 5 and 6, and return the result".

Try a code cell where you set the name ``c`` to refer to the result of ``5 +
6``.

Make a code cell where you set the name ``d`` to refer to the result of ``(10
+ 5 + 1) / 4``.

****************************
The Notebook as a calculator
****************************

The code cell shows output, when it ends with RHS without a LHS.  The RHS can
be a number, or a variable, as we have seen before, but it can also be an
*expression*.  So, we can make a code cell like this:

.. nbplot::

    >>> (10 + 5 + 1) / 4
    4.0

Notice, we didn't use any variables. The RHS, on its own, is ``(10 + 5 + 1) /
4`` is an expression - some code that returns a value.

This means that we can use the Notebook as a simple calculator. You've
already seen ``+`` and ``/`` and the parentheses. You also have ``*`` for
multiply, and ``-`` for subtract, and ``**`` for to-the-power-of.  For
example, here's :math:`10^4`:

.. nbplot::

    >>> 10 ** 4
    10000

Try calculating :math:`6 (2^3) / 4` (it should equal 12):

Try :math:`1024^2 / 2^{16}` (it should equal 16).

***************
Using variables
***************

The great value of variables is that we can use them in calculations. For
example, we might be interested in the result of :math:`2 x^2 + 3x + 10`. We
want to calculate what answer we get for :math:`x = 2`.

.. nbplot::

    >>> x = 2
    >>> x
    2

.. nbplot::

    >>> 2 * x ** 2 + 3 * x + 10
    24

Now we can simply get the answer for :math:`x = 7`, or any other value
of :math:`x`:

.. nbplot::

    >>> x = 7
    >>> 2 * x ** 2 + 3 * x + 10
    129

******************************
Comments begin with a hash (#)
******************************

The code cells in this Notebook, and all the Notebooks we'll use in the class,
will be in the Python programming language. In that language (and many
others), a line beginning with ``#`` is a *comment*, which means that Python
does not do anything with that line, and it just serves to explain the code.

.. nbplot::

    >>> # This is a comment.  It doesn't do anything.
    >>> # This is another comment.  It is just for your reading pleasure.
    >>> # The line below sets the variable c to have value 10.
    >>> c = 10
    >>> # The last line is an expression, and so we see an output of this expression
    >>> # after the cell.
    >>> c
    10

********************
Strings contain text
********************

So far we have only seen numbers. Another type of information that Python can
store and use, is text. Python calls text data: *strings*. For example, here I
set the variable ``my_name`` to the *string* ``'Matthew'``. Notice the quotes
around the string. The quotes tell Python that this is text (string) data:

.. nbplot::

    >>> my_name = 'Matthew'
    >>> my_name
    'Matthew'

What happens when I miss off the quotes in the line above?

You can use single quotes (``'``) to go round strings, or double quotes
(``"``). It doesn't matter to Python, it recognizes you want to make a string.

.. nbplot::

    >>> # I'm setting your_name to the string 'Alphonse' using single quotes
    >>> your_name = 'Alphonse'
    >>> your_name
    'Alphonse'

.. nbplot::

    >>> # But I could have used double quotes, it ends up the same to Python.
    >>> third_name = "Alphonse"
    >>> third_name
    'Alphonse'

************************
Functions process things
************************

Python also has *functions*. It is easiest to explain a function by example.
``len`` is a function, returning the length of something. Here we get the
length of the string:

.. nbplot::

    >>> len('Alphonse')
    8

The result that Python returned from ``len`` is the number of characters in
the string ``'Alphonse'``. The variable ``your_name`` also points to the
string ``'Alphonse'``, so we get the same result from calling ``len`` on the
variable ``your_name``:

.. nbplot::

    >>> len(your_name)
    8

The function has a name - ``len``. We call it, by using its name and then an
opening parenthesis, and then the *arguments* that we want to send to the
function, and then a closing parenthesis.

In this case the function ``len`` accepts only one argument, which is the
thing we want the length of.

Now try setting the variable ``my_name`` to a string containing your first
(given) name. Then get the Notebook to tell you how many characters there are
in your name. Here's how I would do that, in the cell below. You can edit the
cell to put your name in there instead.

.. nbplot::

    >>> my_name = 'Matthew'
    >>> len(my_name)
    7

There are functions which work on numbers as well. For example, the function
``max`` accepts two (or more) numbers, and returns the maximum:

.. nbplot::

    >>> max(10, 4)
    10

******************************
What type of thing have I got?
******************************

So far we have seen two different types of thing that a variable can refer to
- numbers and strings.

We often want to find out what type of thing a variable refers to.  We can use
the function ``type`` for this.  For example:

.. nbplot::

    >>> # Set name "a" to refer to the number 5
    >>> a = 5
    >>> # What type of thing does "a" refer to?
    >>> type(a)
    <class 'int'>

Here ``a`` refers to an integer (whole number).

.. nbplot::

    >>> # What type of thing does "my_name" refer to?
    >>> type(my_name)
    <class 'str'>

``my_name`` refers to a string.

*****
Lists
*****

Python has other useful types of data. One very useful type is the *list*.
Here is a list of two numbers:

.. nbplot::

    >>> my_list = [10, 4]
    >>> my_list
    [10, 4]

Notice the square brackets around the list items, and a comma between the
items.

What do you think you will get calling ``len`` on this list? Try it.

.. nbplot::

    >>> # Try: len(my_list)

You can make an empty list by putting nothing between the brackets:

.. nbplot::

    >>> my_empty_list = []
    >>> my_empty_list
    []

Another thing we might want to do to a list is append a value.  We can do this
using the ``append`` *method* of the list.  A *method* is a function attached
to a value.  This is best seen in action:

.. nbplot::

    >>> my_list.append(7)
    >>> my_list
    [10, 4, 7]

.. nbplot::

    >>> my_list.append(1)
    >>> my_list
    [10, 4, 7, 1]

Notice that we *call* the method using the name of the list - here
``my_list``, followed by a dot, followed by the name of the method, here
``append``.  ``append`` is a function attached to ``my_list``.

Don't worry about the details at the moment, we will have many chances to get
used this this idea.

***********************
Careful of the brackets
***********************

You need square brackets - ``[`` and ``]`` to make a list.  If you use
parentheses ``()`` or curly brackets ``{}`` - you'll get something other than
a list - be careful.

******************************
Set equal to and test equal to
******************************

We have been setting the values of variables with the variable name (e.g.
`my_name`) followed by the equals character `=` and then the value. For
example:

.. nbplot::

    >>> # Setting variable my_name to have value "Matthew"
    >>> my_name = "Matthew"

This is the use of equal to mean "set the variable on the left equal to the
value on the right".

There is another use of "equal" which is to test whether something is equal to
something else.  This is called "test equals".  Python uses double equal signs
``==`` for that meaning of equals.  For example, here we test whether the
value of variable ``my_name`` is equal to the string `'John'`:

.. nbplot::

    >>> # Equal in the sense of test equal to
    >>> my_name == 'John'
    False

Notice that test-equal, with ``==``, is an expression, that returns the value
``True`` if the two sides are equal, and ``False`` if they are not:

.. nbplot::

    >>> # Equal in the sense of test equal to
    >>> my_name == 'Matthew'
    True

********
Packages
********

So far all the stuff we have seen uses functions that Python will always
give you. For example, ``len`` and ``max`` are always available to you,
whenever you start Python.

There are many other things that Python keeps in *modules*. Modules are
libraries of functions and other things, that you cannot use, until you
load them into Python. You load them into Python using the ``import``
command.

For example, we are soon going to be using the ``random`` module. This
is a module that gives us random numbers of various sorts. Before we can
use the ``random`` module, we have to ``import`` it - like this:

.. nbplot::

    >>> import random

What type of thing is this?

.. nbplot::

    >>> type(random)
    <class 'module'>

Now we have the random module loaded, we can access its functions, by
typing the module name ``random``, followed by a dot, followed by the
function we want to use. For example, ``random`` has a function
``randint``, that returns a number between the first argument (the low
bound) and the second argument (the high bound). We can get a random
number between 0 and 10 like this:

.. nbplot::
    :hide-from: all
    :show-to: doctest

    >>> random.seed(1939)

.. nbplot::

    >>> random.randint(0, 10)
    9

.. _getting-help:

********
Exercise
********

Using what you have learned above, make a cell that creates an empty list,
then appends three random numbers between 0 and 100.

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- Make an empty list.
    >>> #- Make a random number between 0 and 100
    >>> #- Append it to the list
    >>> #- Do this three times
    >>> #- Show the new list with three numbers.

************
Getting help
************

Often we want to know what a function does, or how many arguments it takes.
The Notebook has a useful feature to help us. Type the name of the function
you are interested in, followed by ``?`` and press Shift-Enter. The Notebook
will show you pane of help on that function.  Try it now, for ``len`` and
``max``.

.. nbplot::

    >>> # Type (e.g):
    >>> #
    >>> # len?
    >>> #
    >>> # in the cell below

It is also common that we want to know what functions or other goodies there
are in a module.  The Notebook can help with that too.  In the code cell
below, try typing `random.` (note the trailing dot) and then, without pressing
Return, press the Tab key.  The Notebook shows you a list of functions and
other things inside the ``random`` module.  This is called "Tab completion".

.. nbplot::

    >>> # Type:
    >>> #
    >>> # random.
    >>> #
    >>> # followed by Tab, in the cell below
