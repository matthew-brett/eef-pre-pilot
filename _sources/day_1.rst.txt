*********************************
Morning - thinking about sampling
*********************************

* 10.00 - 10.15 - Are there too few Brexiteers in the survey?  How would we
  decide?
* 10.15 - 10.45 - another problem of proportions.  If a family has 4 children,
  what is the probability that the family has 3 girls?  A simulation.
* 10 minute break
* 10.55 - 11.15 - what is the algorithm?
* 11.15 - 12.00 - the machinery we will need: :doc:`print_if_for`.

**************************************
Afternoon - probability and simulation
**************************************

* back for ``for`` loops in :doc:`print_if_for`.
* lists in :doc:`lists`.
* solving with simulation; :doc:`three_girls`;
* :doc:`functions`.
* back to Brexit.  Formulating the null hypothesis.  The population and the
  sample; parameter and statistic. Simulating samples, and therefore,
  statistics.  The sampling distribution.  Has the poll taken a random
  sample of Brexit voters? :doc:`brexit_proportions_exercise`.
* the age distribution problem.  The mean as a statistic.  Null hypothesis
  comparing distributions.  :doc:`more_on_lists`.
* :doc:`brexit_ages` on the Brexit data.
