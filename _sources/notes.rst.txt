For loops were very confusing.  It was the loop variable that really tripped
people up.

Multiple levels of indentation are very hard to understand.  Maybe introduce
functions earlier as a way round that.

If / then / else / elif ?

Emphasise iterating through values in a list.  Or maybe that's kind of
cheating.

Debugging, explicitly.  Print debug.  What to do when you get really stuck.

Explicit help on debugging.  Writing stuff down on paper.

Mean and standard deviation with loops, and lists.

Maybe more on probability, card games.

Break in a while loop?

From "Think like a computer scientist"

Values - 1 "Matthew"

    A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. We
    have only seen the assignment statement so far. Some other kinds of
    statements that we’ll see shortly are while statements, for statements, if
    statements, and import statements. (There are other kinds too!)

    An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to
    functions. Expressions need to be evaluated. If you ask Python to print an
    expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.

    The evaluation of an expression produces a value.

    When reading or writing code, say to yourself “n is assigned 17” or “n
    gets the value 17” or “n is a reference to the object 17” or “n refers to
    the object 17”. Don’t say “n equals 17”.

Reference diagrams::

    >>> p = 17

::

    p -> 17

    Essentially I’m telling you once again, start small, get something small
    working, and then add to it.

    Get something working and keep it working

    Everyone is a suspect (Except Python)!

    Find clues. This is the biggest job of the detective and right now there
    are two important kinds of clues for you to understand.
