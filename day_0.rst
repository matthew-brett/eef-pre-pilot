2 hour break.

************************************
Afternoon - expressing steps in code
************************************

* 14.00 - 14.55 - :doc:`assignment`.

Homework
********

* Download the Notebook from :doc:`brexit_analysis`. Download the data to the
  same folder.  Make sure you can run the Notebook without error.
* The Notebook replicates the calculation you have already done, showing that
  the proportion of Leave voters seems to be a lot smaller than the proportion
  in the referendum.  Now imagine I represent the survey company.   You tell
  me the proportion in the survey is too low, so my survey must have been
  biased to select Remain voters.  I say the explanation is that I took a
  random sample of UK voters, and got them to give honest answers, but, by
  chance, my random sample happened to have more Remain voters than the
  general population.  In other words, the proportion in the survey differs
  from the referendum due to "sampling error".  You disagree, and think the
  error is too great for this to be the explanation, but how will you convince
  me?  We will go through your suggestions tomorrow.
* Use the Notebook to work out the average age of the Leave voters, and the
  average age of the Remain voters.  You may need to explore the Notebook and
  Google to find out how to do this. Try search terms like "pandas" and
  "mean" and "column". Is the difference you found a big difference or a small
  difference?  How would you decide?  Bring your Notebooks tomorrow.
